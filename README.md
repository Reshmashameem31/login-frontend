# Login Page Frontend

This is the frontend of the **Login-Page** project, built with **React** and **Vite**.  

The app starts with a **Login Page**. After a successful login, the user is redirected to the **Book Finder** page, where they can search for books using the Google Books API.

It connects to a backend API deployed on **Render** for authentication.
